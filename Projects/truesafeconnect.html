                <p>I designed wireframes for a home security android mobile application, TrueSafe Connect. TrueSafe is a series of IoT-enabled gas leak sensors.
                  Customers are provided with a mobile app to keep track of their sensor devices and be notified if an alarm is raised by the sensor.
                  I delivered designs for the mobile app within a short timeline to publish it on the
                  <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vighnaharta.truesafe" id = "link">Google Play Store</a>.</p>

                <p>I worked with <a target="_blank" href="https://vighnaharta.in/" id = "link">Vighnaharta Technologies</a> during August-September 2017. As the designer,
                  <span id="imp">it was my responsibility to deliver high-fidelity wireframes for an android mobile application.</span> I engaged with the primary stakeholders
                  of this project – the CTO and Project Manager to understand their requirements and vision for the product. I asked a lot of questions, specifically to understand
                  <span id="imp">how is the product engineered and how exactly does it work. My aim was to be able to define the role of the mobile app in the product ecosystem.</span>

            <div class = "col-sm-7">
                <p>Through the initial conversations, I understood that the target users for this app would be homeowners, chefs in commercial kitchens, security guards
                  in warehouses, etc. which implied <span id="imp">people with varying levels of technical expertise.</span></p>
                <p id="second-para">Through my initial research and stakeholder discussions, I realized that amongst all the features, onboarding new users is a relatively
                  complex process. <span id="imp">Device registration would be the most difficult yet crucial step in the workflow.</span></p>
                <p id="second-para">I decided to explore this workflow, that of a new customer buying a TrueSafe product. <span id="imp">I mapped the user’s journey when they
                  register a sensor device for the first time, which helped me consider the glitches that could potentially occur.</span> This process also brought
                  clarity from a technical perspective.</p>

                <p>By visualizing the journey, it became evident that this process was not straightforward. Therefore, I broke down the device registration process into

                  that included all relevant color codes, measurements of components, and links that would guide the team.</p>
