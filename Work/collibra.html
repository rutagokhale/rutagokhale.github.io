                <p>At Collibra, I got the opportunity to lead and co-own different projects. Reflecting on my work and responsibilities,
                  these were some of the things I did in addition to designing:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li><i>Achieve stakeholder alignment</i>
                        <p>This was the most important part of my job, especially during the initial stages of a project. I worked with the product manager to
                          scope features by reviewing available data and taking informed next steps.</p></li>
                      <li><i>Evolve the design process</i>
                        <p>This was a fun part of my job where all of us were working towards a common goal of making collaboration effective and efficient,
                          be it through mini-workshops, frequent touchpoints, clearer user stories, or specific Slack updates. </p></li>
                      <li><i>Collaborate successfully across time zones</i>
                        <p>I joined this company and my team remotely. My product team and I were separated by a 9-hour time difference. I improved my skills
                          in design documentation and written collaboration which allowed for asynchronous communication.</p></li>
