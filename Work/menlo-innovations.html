                        <li>I <span id="imp">co-designed wireframes for various B2B software.</span> To enable effective collaboration, I practiced thinking out loud and asking for feedback often.</li>
                        <li>I worked in agile teams that operated on a weekly cadence. As designers, along with the actual design work, we <span id="imp">estimated user stories, provided design support to front-end developers, and presented our work to clients.</span></li>
                        <li>I <span id="imp">wrote user stories</span> for every design I created, <span id="imp">describing the intent and specs</span> for the developers to work on.</li>
                        <li>I collaborated with the Project Manager for <span id="imp">planning, prioritizing, and scheduling work</span> based on business outcomes and user data.</li>
