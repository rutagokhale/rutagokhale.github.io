                <p>I designed wireframes for a home security android mobile application, TrueSafe Connect. TrueSafe is a series of IoT enabled gas leak sensors. Customers are provided with a mobile app to keep track of their sensor devices and be notified if an alarm is raised by the sensor. I delivered designs for the mobile app within a short timeline to publish it on <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vighnaharta.truesafe" id = "link">Google Play Store</a>.</p>

                <p>I worked with <a target="_blank" href="https://vighnaharta.in/" id = "link">Vighnaharta Technologies</a> from August-September 2017 to design wireframes for a mobile application. I got involved in this project in the later stages when the team already had a sensor prototype, and the mobile application was ready to be developed. As a designer, <span id="imp">it was my responsibility to deliver high-fidelity wireframes for an android mobile app.</span></p>
                <p id="second-para">Before beginning the work as a designer, I engaged with the primary stakeholders of this project – CTO and Project Manager to understand their requirements and vision for the product. In the initial meeting, we discussed deliverables and timelines for this project.</p>
                <p id="second-para"><span id="imp">I asked a lot of questions, specifically to understand how the product is engineered and how exactly it works. My aim was to be able to define the role of mobile app in the product ecosystem.</span></p>

            <div class = "col-sm-6">
                <p>After asking about target users, I understood they are going to be homeowners, chefs in commercial kitchens, security guards in warehouses, etc. which implied that <span id="imp">people with varying levels of technical expertise would be using this app.</span></p>
                <p id="second-para">Through stakeholder discussions, I realized that amongst all the features, onboarding new customers is a relatively complex workflow. <span id="imp">Device registration was the most difficult yet crucial step of the onboarding process.</span></p>
                <p id="second-para">I decided to explore this workflow, that of a new customer buying a Truesafe product. <span id="imp">I mapped the user’s journey when they register a sensor device for the first time, which helped me consider the glitches that could potentially occur.</span> This process also brought clarity from a technical perspective.</p>

                <p>By visualizing the journey, it became evident that this process was not straightforward. Therefore, I broke down the device registration process into three simple steps with clear instructions that could be easily understood.</p>

                </div>
                <p>I sought to create simple and minimalistic designs. I created an interactive prototype using Google Material Design guidelines for mocking high fidelity screens due to its extensive documentation, and easy compatibility with android phones. I also designed icons to supplement the wireframes. I prepared visual specs design documents for developers that included all relevant color codes, measurement of components, and links that would guide the team.</p>
